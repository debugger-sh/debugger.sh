   * These edits form a perfect log of all textual changes to the document, such that

   *
   * With that said, to save on egress, two edits may be merged together if:
   *
   *  1. They occur within 500ms of one another.
   *  2. It is possible to represent them as a single edit (i.e. they are textually adjacent)
   *  3. They share the same reason.
   *
   * For example, consider two edits A happens before B that satisfy (1) and (3), where
   *
   * ```
   * A = { offset: 0, deleted: 2, inserted: "hel" }
   * B = { offset: 3, deleted: 0, inserted: "lo" }
   * ```
   *
   * it is possible to merge these edits into a single edit
   *
   * ```
   * A|B = { offset: 0, deleted: 2, inserted: "hello" }
   * ```
   *
   * However, edits like
   *
   * ```
   * A' = { offset: 0, deleted: 2, inserted: "hel" }
   * B' = { offset: 4, deleted: 0, inserted: "o" }
   * ```
   *
   * cannot be merged since they are not adjacent.
   *
   * Put simply, these rules state that it is possible to debounce edits, so long as they are
   * temporally and textually adjacent and have the same reason.
   *
   * If multiple simultaneous edits occur, their timestamp should be artificially incremented by the smallest supported resolution
   * on the client to spread them out into a total order.
